Hello! This is a simple web scraper that I wrote as a coding challenge for an interview. 

Assuming you have two items in your cart on the Kohl's home page, it grabs data about those items and displays that information in an overlay that is created by a scroll trigger at the bottom of the page. The code runs by being copied, pasted, and executed in the dev tools console.

This was a neat exercise, and I intend to use it as a basis for writing a much larger web scraping utility in the future!
